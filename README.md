Objective:
The objective of the project is to find out whether the user input random number is an even or odd number, using a Python Programming Language.

Task: 
1)	The program should ask the user to enter any random number
2)	The program then should tell the user that the number is even or odd
3)	Each time, the program should ask the user whether he/she wants to try another number 
 
Assumption: 
The user will input whole numbers

Process: 
1)	User is asked to enter any integer
2)	Whether the integer is even or odd, is being found out
3)	If the integer is even, a message “You entered an even number” is displayed and the user is asked whether he/she wants to try another     number
4)	If the integer is odd, a message “You entered an odd number” is displayed and the user is asked whether he/she wants to try another       number
5)	If the user answer is “yes”, then the user is guided displaying the messages “Go ahead!” and “Please enter any random number”
6)	If the user answer is “no”, then the program is closed displaying a message “Goodbye!”
